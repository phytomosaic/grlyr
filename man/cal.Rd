\description{
Calibration data using 150 destructive samples, used to build a
    calibration model for non-destructive estimation of ground
    layer biomass, carbon and nitrogen content.  Samples were
    collected in 2012 and 2013 from Oregon and Alaska, USA.
}
\details{
Destructive samples were collected to parameterize a nondestructive
     estimation model for the US Forest Service's Forest Inventory
     and Analysis program.  The specific FIA protocol is the
     'Ground Layer Indicator' (FIA 2018), first implemented as part
     of the Interior Alaska Inventory beginning in 2014.  The
     calibration model (a negative exponential function) is fully
     parameterized and described in Smith et al. (2015).  The
     simplified functional groups in this dataset must be
     crosswalked to their expanded versions prior to estimation.
